# IDC-dominant-gene
Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) is a type of ductal carcinoma which is one of the breast cancers that started in the milk duct of womenâ€™s breasts. 

The two most common genes that cause IDC are TP53 and ERBB2. To determine which gene is the dominant one, statistical analysis is performed using R.
The analysis carried out includes:
- checking for outliers
- normality of the genes
- mean and median values
- GC content

Based on the results from the analysis, gene ERBB2 plays dominant role in IDC.
